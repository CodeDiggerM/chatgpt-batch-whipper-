# ðŸ¦® Welcome to ChatGPT Batch Whipper ðŸ¦®


The ChatGPT Batch Whipper is a tool designed to simplify batch jobs using ChatGPT. With this tool, you can:

* Save and reuse prompts, making it easy to apply them to multiple inputs automatically using an input CSV file.
* Ensure continuity and coherence by submitting input data for the same prompt to the same conversation.
* Resume the batch job from where you left off, even if you unintentionally stop the process, thanks to the tool's data saving feature.
* Never worry about exceeding hourly submit times, as the tool waits until it can run again.
In short, the ChatGPT Batch Whipper tool is an efficient and user-friendly way to perform batch jobs with ChatGPT. We welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have, so give it a try and see how it can improve your workflow!
Thanks to @mmabrouk some of codes were inspired and modified from his [repo](https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper).
